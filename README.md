# FakeShield (Cybersecurity Fake News Detector)

A web-based tool designed to analyze URLs or text content for potential fake news related to cybersecurity, providing a verdict and detailed analysis.

## Overview

The Cybersecurity Fake News Detector is a full-stack web application that allows users to input a URL or text snippet to determine its credibility in the context of cybersecurity news. Built with HTML, CSS, and a modern design, it aims to help users combat misinformation by leveraging analysis tools (backend not included in this repo).

## Features

- **Dual Input Options**: Analyze content via URL or direct text input.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern UI with a gradient background, shadows, and smooth transitions.
- **Detailed Results**: Displays a verdict with confidence percentage and a breakdown of analysis details.
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive form layout and clear feedback with error handling.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-fake-news-detector.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cybersecurity-fake-news-detector
   ```
3. **Open in Browser**:
   - Open `index.html` for the input form.
   - Open `result.html` to view a sample result page.
   - *(Note: Backend integration is required for full functionality; this repo contains only the frontend.)*

## Usage

1. Launch the application by opening `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Choose an input method:
   - Select "URL" and enter a link (e.g., `https://example.com`).
   - Select "Text" and paste content into the text area.
3. Click "Analyze" to submit (requires backend setup for actual analysis).
4. View results on the `result.html` page, including verdict, confidence, and details.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling with gradients, shadows, and responsive design.
- **Jinja2**: Templating for dynamic content (assumed for backend integration).
